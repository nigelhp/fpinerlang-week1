### Functional Programming in Erlang: Week 1 Assignment

##### Shapes
Define a function perimeter/1 which takes a shape and returns the perimeter of the shape.

Choose a suitable representation of triangles, and augment area/1 and perimeter/1 to handle this case too.

Define a function enclose/1 that takes a shape an returns the smallest enclosing rectangle of the shape.

#####Summing the bits
Define a function bits/1 that takes a positive integer N and returns the sum of the bits in the binary representation. For example bits(7) is 3 and bits(8) is 1.

See whether you can make both a direct recursive and a tail recursive definition.

Which do you think is better? Why?
